## Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. Start the AI service: `cd ai && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000`
2. Start the backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
3. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`

### For Users
1. Click the microphone button to start recording
2. Speak your message
3. Click again to stop recording
4. View transcription in the popup
5. Use text-to-speech button to hear transcription
6. Voice commands will be processed automatically

## Next Steps for Enhancement
